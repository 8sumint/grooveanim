requires a midi source (some loopback driver?)
or if you're cool use a hardware sequencer

editor keys:
    enter   enter the editor
    arrows  move focused instrument
        +shift, ctrl for different amounts
    numbers select focused instrument (shift+numbers for more)
    C       focus chords
    D       focus drums
    A       toggle showing all instruments
    R       reload setup from disk
    S       save setup back to disk
    Q       quit

oh you can also click the mouse to move the focused instrument there

text animation:
setup lines in the json..
imagine your base note is 30... the map would be

    36 set mode based on velocity
    35 reset everything
    34 set visibility from note velocity (>64 is visible)
    33 submit (copy buffered progress to progress in submit mode)
    32 do "next" twice
    31 "next": depending on mode go to next line or increase progress
    30 reset line progress and go to next line

and you can sequence that
